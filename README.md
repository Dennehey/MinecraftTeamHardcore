# Minecraft Team Hardcore - You die, we die

This mod/script will cause the server (on any player death) to delete the world(s), and restart the server.  Like hardcore minecraft but you have to hope your friends don't die too!  


This script is paired with bukkit/spigot and custom death message mod (https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/custom-death-messages)- it's possible new death types will not be captured, and I'm sure I'll totally update it for each one... If anyone knows of an external trigger to capture for deaths in an external script I am all ears
