# Minecraft Team Hardcore - You die, we die

This mod/script will cause the server (on any player death) to delete the world(s), and restart the server.  Like hardcore Minecraft but you have to hope your friends don't die too!  


This script is paired with bukkit/spigot and custom death message mod (https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/custom-death-messages)- it's possible new death types will not be captured given this scripts reliance on the death message outputted to the log. If anyone knows of a way to trigger a script from inside MC or to do this better I am all ears!


# Install Instructions

Follow https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/, pull this repo into your folder, launch start_server.bat, then launch the powershell script from inside powershell
